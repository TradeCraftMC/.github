# TradeCraft
TradeCraft is a comprehensive Minecraft plugin that adds an currency or item based economy system, with a fully functional and beautiful web UI. 

TradeCraft maintains a variety of forks from useful projects, typically to keep them up-to-date and usable within TradeCraft. To keep everything in one place, this GitHub organisation was created.
